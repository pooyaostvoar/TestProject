# üê≥ Docker Setup for Local Development

This project uses Docker and Docker Compose to simplify local development and manage dependencies like the PostgreSQL database.

---

## üìÅ Environment Setup

Before running the application, create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=bookdb
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:password@db:5432/bookdb
```

These are used by both the `db` and `web` services in Docker Compose.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Services Overview

### üì¶ `db` (PostgreSQL)

- Based on the `postgres:15` image  
- Stores data in a persistent Docker volume  
- Listens on port `5433` (maps to internal `5432`)

### üöÄ `web` (FastAPI App)

- Runs the FastAPI app with `uvicorn`  
- Reloads code automatically on changes  
- Depends on `db`  
- Uses the `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the App

To build and run the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## üìò API Docs

Once the app is running, explore the API documentation:

- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- ReDoc: [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

These tools show available endpoints, schemas, and example `curl` commands.

## Testing

### Overview
The project uses SQLite for testing purposes to ensure lightweight and fast testing. When running the tests, the SQLite database is used by default, and it is set up and torn down automatically before and after each test.

### Running Tests Locally
To run the tests locally, ensure you have all dependencies installed and set up the environment as follows:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the tests with pytest. You can use the following command:

    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=. pytest
    ```

   This command will run all tests and ensure that Python can correctly find your modules, especially when they are in subdirectories or not in the same directory as your test file. The `PYTHONPATH` is set to the current directory (`.`) to ensure that your code is correctly imported during testing.

### Test Environment
- **Database**: The tests are run using SQLite by default. 
- **Test Setup**: Each test is run in isolation with a fresh database setup, ensuring that tests are independent and there is no data persistence between tests.

### Continuous Integration
On every pull request, the tests will run in a GitHub Actions CI pipeline using the same SQLite setup, ensuring that all tests pass before merging the PR.

For more details about the CI pipeline, see the `ci.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Migrations

### Local Development (SQLite)

For local development, the database is configured to use SQLite (when you're running the tests).

### Switching to PostgreSQL in Production

To switch to PostgreSQL in production:

Modify the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to use PostgreSQL (e.g., `postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:port/database`).

For more detail you can check this [README](https://github.com/pooyaostvoar/TestProject/blob/main/alembic/README.md)

### Linter and Code Formatter

This project uses **Flake8** for linting and **Black** for automatic code formatting. Below is the information on how to run these tools manually.

#### 1. Linting with Flake8

**Flake8** is a tool for checking the style guide enforcement and code quality of your Python code.

To run **Flake8** manually in the `app` folder:

```bash
flake8 app/
```

This command will check all Python files in the `app` directory for linting issues based on the project's style rules.

#### 2. Formatting with Black

**Black** is a code formatter that reformats your Python code to ensure consistent style across the project.

To format the code manually using **Black** in the `app` folder:

```bash
black app/
```

This command will automatically format the code in the `app` directory according to Black's strict rules.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

Throughout the project, I followed a feature-driven development approach:

### Branching: 
Each feature was developed in its own dedicated branch to keep changes isolated and organized.

### Atomic Commits: 
Commits were made incrementally and kept atomic, making it easier to review the code history. Reviewing by commit can help you understand the development flow clearly.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD): 
I aimed to follow the TDD cycle ‚Äî write a failing test, implement the feature, and then refactor/improve. This ensured a test-first approach and higher confidence in the codebase.

### README Updates: 
After implementing each feature, I made sure to update the README accordingly to reflect the changes and usage.

### Docker Setup: 
A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml were created for development purposes. While the current setup is tailored for local dev, there's room for improvement with a production-ready deployment configuration (e.g., a separate docker-compose.prod.yml and GitHub workflow to push images to a Docker registry).

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions: 
A GitHub Action workflow was added to automatically run all tests when a pull request is made. This helps ensure the code is stable before merging.

### Pull Requests: 
After setting up the GitHub Action, I submitted all remaining changes via PRs to ensure they were properly tested and reviewed.
